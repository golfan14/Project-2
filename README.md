# Project-2
Body Book is a company that will ensure you can keep your personal health in tact, while dealing with the hustle and bustle of everyday life. Information such as vaccine history or your last checkup may not seem overly important, but without it we subject ourselves to uninformed professionals, resulting in questionable medical procedures. With Body Book you can keep all your health information at your finger tips, including, but not limited to, setting up new appointments and a list of medications you are allergic to. Here at Body Book we strive to minimize the amount of medical mixups, regardless of how serious or trivial they may be.
